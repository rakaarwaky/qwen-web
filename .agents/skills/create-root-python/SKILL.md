# create-root-python

Root = **composition layer** that assembles the system. Connects concrete implementations to contracts and starts the application. May depend on all layers.

## Two Root Roles

| Role | Suffix | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Container | `_container` | Wire one feature's Capabilities to Contracts |
| Entry | `_entry` | Bootstrap application, compose feature containers |

## Definition of Done

1. Correct suffix: `_container` or `_entry`.
2. Container: wires Capabilities to Contract protocols/aggregates.
3. Entry: bootstraps application and composes feature containers.
4. May instantiate and wire components.
5. No business logic.
6. No orchestration policy.
7. No technical parsing or UI behavior.
8. `python -c "import <module>"` passes.

## Workflow

1. **Determine role** — Container (wire one feature) or Entry (bootstrap all)?
2. **Create file** → `root_<concept>_<suffix>.py`.
3. **Wire deps** → Connect Capabilities to Contract interfaces/aggregates.
4. **Verify** → `python -c "import <module>"`.
